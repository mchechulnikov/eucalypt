# Eucalypt
Test assessment: script execution server. Currently only C# scripts are supported

## About
* Ktor for HTTP server
* Script runners – a.k.a. executors – are Docker containers with memory, CPU restrictions and network isolation. Also TMPFS used instead of real filesystem
* Containers ran from pre-build images located `./src/src/images`
* Executres united in pool. It's is able to automaticaly extend and shink it's own size, detects hanged executors and re-run them

## How to run
### Prerequsites
* Docker
* Gradle
* GNU Make
* curl
* IDEA

It has been written and tested on MacBook Pro (14-inch, 2021) Apple M1 Pro, RAM 32 GB via IntelliJ IDEA 2021.3.3 (Ultimate Edition).

Before first run you must build executos images
```
make build.images
```

### Run
Since project was generated by Ktor template from IntelliJ IDEA you need only
```
./src/gradlew
```
or just run from IntelliJ IDEA.

### Try
Check some examples in `./examples` directory. You can easly CURL it via makefile. <br/>
To print available tasks
```
make
```

To build executors' images
```
make build.images
```

To run example first of all run server and then make
```
make dotnet.hw      # hello world!
make dotnet.fib     # Fibonacci numbers up to 42
make dotnet.fio     # writes some lines to file and reads it
make dotnet.inf     # infinity operation
make dotnet.inv     # invalid code that doesn't compile
```

### Pool management processes
Executors have several states:
* NEW – just created; should be checked for readiness
* READY – ready for execution
* RESERVED – locked for specific task; state can be changed only by original task or can be killed by double timeout
* EXECUTING – in the middle of execution; can be killed by timeout
* RELEASED – unlocked by task; should be reset
* RESET – in the middle of reset
* ELIMINATED – marked for elimination; should be destoryed

``` mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    %% creating
    [*] --> NEW: register new
    NEW --> READY: enable

    %% execution
    READY --> RESERVED: borrow for execution
    RESERVED --> EXECUTING: start execution
    EXECUTING --> RELEASED: success
    RELEASED --> RESET: reset 

    %% execution not started or starvation
    RESERVED --> RESET: double timeout
    EXECUTING --> RESET: timeout
    
    %% reset
    RESET --> READY: enable

    %% elimination
    READY --> ELIMINATED: shrink pool size
    ELIMINATED --> [*]: destroy
```

#### Executor creating
``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    activate Pool Manager
        Pool Manager ->> Pool Manager: register executor
        note right of Pool Manager: state of executor is CREATED

        Pool Manager ->> Pool: create container
        activate Pool
            Pool -->> Pool Manager: command executed
        deactivate Pool

        loop poll every N ms
            Pool Manager ->> Pool: check if container in ready state
            activate Pool
        end

        Pool -->> Pool Manager: container is ready!
        deactivate Pool

        Pool Manager ->> Pool Manager: enable executor
        note right of Pool Manager: state of executor is READY

    deactivate Pool Manager
```

#### Release and reset executor
``` mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    note right of Task Runner: ...
    Task Runner -) Pool Manager: ASYNC return used executor
    activate Pool Manager
        Pool Manager ->> Pool Manager: release executor
        note right of Pool Manager: state of executor is RELEASED
    deactivate Pool Manager

    note right of Pool Manager: force to start reset operation
    activate Pool Manager
        Pool Manager ->> Pool Manager: reset executor
        note right of Pool Manager: state of executor is RESET

        Pool Manager ->> Pool: reset executor
        activate Pool
            Pool -->> Pool Manager: command executed
        deactivate Pool

        loop poll every N ms
            Pool Manager ->> Pool: check if container in ready state
            activate Pool
        end

        Pool -->> Pool Manager: container is ready!
        deactivate Pool

        Pool Manager ->> Pool Manager: enable executor for further executions
